# Do not rename/delete any functions or global variables provided in this template and write your solution
# in the specified sections. Use the main function to test your code when running it from a terminal.
# Avoid writing that code in the global scope; however, you should write additional functions/classes
# as needed in the global scope. These templates may also contain important information and/or examples
# in comments so please read them carefully. If you want to use external packages not specified in the
# assignment then you need prior approval from course staff.
